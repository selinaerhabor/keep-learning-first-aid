              One of our most frequently asked questions is why exactly Keep Learning First Aid products are much cheaper compared to the rest of our competitors. 
              This is a simple one, our oldest competitors at St Johnâ€™s Ambulance and British Red Cross operate as registered charities. 
              Being a limited company, KLFA Group can afford to be as competitive as possible, which means passing great savings onto 
              our customers! We believe that life-saving skill training should not cost an arm and a leg and we aim to beat any written quote.

              At the end of First Aid courses, you must complete a multiple-choice question paper. If you fail this, you will have 
              one opportunity to retake. If failed a second time, you will need to book and sit the course again, giving you 2 more 
              opportunities to retake.
